I was hit hard in the face with a baseball six nights ago.

It hurt at first, but not that bad. A bunch of my upper left teeth were somewhat numb, but it's been getting better. Until it sort of stopped getting better yesterday.

So I need to see a specialist doctor ASAP to get it checked out. It's possible the nerves in my teeth are dying. And it seems more likely now that there's a fracture in the upper mandible, if not on the teeth.

In the best case scenario, it all heals on its own (this is what my optimistic mind has been hoping for the past six days).

In the worst case, I need a big surgery, lose some teeth and need to get a bunch of implants, get metal plates on my face, maybe sustain permanent nerve damage to other areas of the face. I guess it could get worse if there's internal bleeding that I haven't been noticing.

I need to go to the ER to expedite the treatment, but the plan is to go very early tomorrow.

So I guess I'm planning for the worst case scenario ahead of time. What if the internal bleeding is so bad that it puts a countdown timer on my life or my productive years?

I just would want to not be lazy. To do the right thing first, quickly, and with urgency. To cultivate the voice instead of planning/plotting everything.
