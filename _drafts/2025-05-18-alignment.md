title: 'Ben Franklin: The Original Large Language Model'

I'm sure others have pointed this out, but here's a passage from his
autobiography where he describes how he trained himself as a writer.

> At this time I met with an odd volume of the "Spectator." I had
> never before seen any of them. I bought it, read it over and over,
> and was much delighted with it. I thought the writing excellent, and
> wished if possible to imitate it. With that view I took some of the
> papers, and making short hints of the sentiments in each sentence,
> laid them by a few days, and then, without looking at the book,
> tried to complete the papers again, by expressing each hinted
> sentiment at length, and as fully as it had been expressed before,
> in any suitable words that should occur to me. Then I compared my "
> Spectator " with the original, discovered some of my faults, and
> corrected them ..

This process -- learning to imitate publications, comparing one's own
writing to the original, and making corrections accordingly, is
remarkably reminiscent of how today's [ChatGPT-style AIs are
trained](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/autoregressive-models/).
