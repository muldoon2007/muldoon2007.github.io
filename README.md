# Running locally
Once ruby stuff is installed, I run:

``` bash
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

Tips:

- `bundle` command needs to be run from the root directory
- The header formatting can be a little wonky and prevent the page
  from compiling. Especially putting a time in the date field. Just
  skip that part. No date necessary if it's already in the title.
- Categories need to be formatted as an array
