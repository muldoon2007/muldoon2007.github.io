I will gladly give you two of hours of free opinions on any of the
below topics, and if you like my snake oil, I'm available for
small-scale consulting projects.

- Logistics and operations research (I spent years in Amazon logistics)
- High-performance computation and scientific simulation (area of focus at Blue Origin)
- Education technology, language learning and knowledge management (first part of my career)
- Useful application of current Large Language Model / AI technologies
- Product management and customer acquisition
- Generating large numbers of crazy ideas
- Specific technologies: AWS, Java, Python (machine learning with
  keras), Javascript/Typescript, Clojure, Emacs, Kubernetes,
  Terraform

I practice "open-source" consulting: I strive to make all
general-purpose materials, code, idea, and frameworks available for
free to the world and bill strictly for time.

(It goes without saying that all prioprietary information stays
proprietary.)
